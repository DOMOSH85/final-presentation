# Farmer Portal App Overhaul Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Client-Side (React/Vite)
- Basic routing with React Router
- Authentication using localStorage and redirects
- Farmer and Government portals with basic CRUD operations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Modal-based authentication

### Server-Side (Node.js/Express)
- REST API with Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose for data models
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization (farmer/government)

## Issues Identified

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Inconsistent use of redirects vs. programmatic navigation
   - No proper state management for authentication
   - Missing persistent login

2. **State Management**
   - No global state management (Redux/Context API)
   - Components manage their own state independently
   - No caching of API responses

3. **Error Handling**
   - Minimal error handling in components
   - No user-friendly error messages
   - No retry mechanisms

4. **UI/UX**
   - Inconsistent styling across components
   - No loading states for async operations
   - Minimal form validation
   - Basic layout with room for improvement

5. **Missing Features**
   - Farmer market prices viewing
   - Government market price management
   - Profile management for both roles
   - Proper navigation within portals
